# Migration Guide, Version 2.0 to 3.0

## Changes

### New file structure

In Madison 3.0, we fully separated the client and server side code. This allowed
us to focus on the server side as an API, and our client as an application that
consumes that API. In the future this would position Madison data and
interactivity to be utilized by third party applications.

In the top level directory you will see `/client` and `/server` folders, each
containing the respective code. At this point in time (3.0) the client is built
with Angular 1 and JavaScript, dependencies are managed with npm. The server
side is built with Laravel and PHP, dependencies managed with composer.

### Built assets no longer committed

In versions of Madison prior to 3.0 we required that you commit built versions
of front end assets to the git repo, as well as committing third party
dependencies installed using various package managers (bower, npm, and
composer). We realized this was an anti-pattern and have made some changes!

First of all, we removed the use of bower as a dependency manager and have
consolidated it's responsibilities into npm, lowering overall complexity. On top
of that we have removed the need to commit packages and built versions of the
front end assets.

These things are now git ignored and will continue to be so. No more making
sure to build and commit your assets before a deploy! It's recommended to build
the client each time you deploy a new version of your code. This process is
automated if you use the new Capistrano setup for deployment as well. (More on
that later).

### Customize your Madison instance!

Before many of the changes in Madison 3.0, to customize your own version of
Madison you had to maintain your own git fork of the codebase. If you wanted to
change styles, language, page content, etc, it required that you make changes to
files that were tracked in the git repository.

We've made serious headway on that front! You can now customize your Madison
instance using some git ignored files.

* `client/app/sass/custom/` holds custom sass files in here to override existing
  styles.
* `client/app/locales/custom/` holds custom locale (language) files in here to
  override language throughout the system.
* Custom content pages and nav links can now be managed by site administrators
  through the interface!

These changes will allow you to keep tracking from the primary Madison repo and
pulling in changes as we move forward without clobbering your instance-specific
customizations.

### Web server reconfiguration

Because the server and client code are served from different directories, the
apache / nginx configuration looks quite a bit different. To see an example of
what this should look like now, check out the [example apache
configuration](/docs/apache.conf.example) provided in our docs folder.

The main thing is that we want the client code to be the primary document root,
and have an alias set up that routes any requests prefixed with `/api` to the
server (Laravel) code.

You can also easily change whether you're looking at a development version of
the client or a built production version by changing the document root to either
`./client/app' for development or `./client/build` for production. This makes
for easy confirmation of a successful build!

### Document sponsorship moidel

Instead of having a separate construct for "independent sponsors" vs "group
sponsors", we simplified the model by merging the handling of "independent
sponsors" into the groups model. Now when a user becomes and independent
sponsor, they are being put into a specially marked group under the title of
their own name. This simplifies handling of document sponsorship related
permissions.

### Make tasks

Due to the split of client and server code and the fact that each piece of the
codebase has it's own dependency manager and build tools, we have added a root
level `Makefile` containing common tasks. Here are some tasks of note:

* `make` - The default task runs `deps` and `build-client`. This will put your
  application in a ready to operate state.
* `make deps` - Installs all dependencies through the system, including
  composer, npm, rubygems, and berks (for Chef).
* `make build-client` - Runs the command to build the client code! To see what's
  involved in this task, checkout `client/scripts/build.sh`.
* `make test` - This will run the whole test suite, both client and server
  tests. More on this in the next section.
* `make db-migrate` - Runs any pending migrations on the database.
* `make db-reset` - Scraps current database, rebuilds it, migrates and seeds
  with data.
* `make queue-listen` - This will launch the background job processor for
  Laravel. Needed for notification handling.
* `make watch` - Runs the npm watch command to detect files changes and
  reprocess where necessary.
* `make chef-prepare` - More on this in the following section on Chef.
* `make chef-cook` - More on this in the following section on Chef.

Of course, you can check out the [top level `Makefile`](Makefile) to see under
the hood and find out what's happening with each of these tasks.

### Running tests

We've made significant progress on our automated testing setup, including
automated test running on GitHub pushes using
[Travis](travis-ci.org/opengovfoundation/madison). There are currently two
levels of tests that are being written / run: client side full integration
tests and server side API integration tests.

* `client/tests/e2e/` contains client integration tests.
* `server/tests/functional/` contains API integration tests.

Client integration tests will test the whole stack of the application. This
means it's expecting a test version of the API server to be up and running for
it to test against. We recommend setting up another Apache (or nginx) virtual
host configured solely for testing. This would point to a different database as
well.

To run the whole test suite (client and server), run `make test`. You can also
individually test just client or just server using `make test-client` and `make
test-server` respectively.

### Provision and deploy w/ chef and cap

A major goal of Madison 3.0 is to ease the process of standing up and managing
your own instance of Madison. The customization work covered above was one piece
of this. Another piece is the automated server provisioning using
[Chef](https://www.chef.io/) and easier deployment using
[Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com)

Instead of covering everything involved in the process here, we've created a
document with instructions on setting up, provisioning, and deploying to a
server using these tools in `docs/DEPLOY.md`.

## Suggested upgrade path

* Clone new copy
* Pull out custom style, locales, etc
