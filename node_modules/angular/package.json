Useful for client-side apps built with Browserify and for testing AngularJS code in Node without depending on a browser.\n\n## Versioning\n\nThe version number of this module reflects the version of AngularJS it provides.\n\n\n## Why\nFor client-side apps using Browserify, this module provides a way for them to use AngularJS without shimming.\n\nHaving a version of AngularJS that works outside the browser could also be convenient for many reasons. The primary motivation was around testability and modularity of AngularJS related projects. For developers utilizing the CommonJS standard and Browserify to build AngularJS projects and ecosystems, the hope is that this module will greatly simplify their workflow.\n\nAs [egghead.io](http://egghead.io) has shown, testing [simple views](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-unit-testing-hello-world) and [directives](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-unit-testing-a-directive) is a great way to ensure the pieces of your app are working as intended. Unfortunately, testing this way usually requires running your code in a real browser via something like Karma, because AngularJS assumes `window` and `document` are both available. Additionally, AngularJS (via `angular-mocks.js`) only exposes the `inject` method shown in the [egghead.io](http://egghead.io) videos if `window.jasmine` is defined.\n\nThis module allows you to test AngularJS views and directives using any testing framework and runner you like, from [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) to [Nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit) to [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape).\n\nThis module also aims to make it much easier to create AngularJS directives, modules, and other components that can be independently published to and versioned on npm and/or their own repositories.\n\n## Examples\n\nThe `inject` method referenced above is really just a shortcut to `$injector.invoke`, but `$injector` is only available from within AngularJS. Fortunately, there are two ways to get a reference to Angular's injector from outside of AngularJS code.\n\n```\n// this will return a fresh instance of injector each time it's called\n// if your code is not running in a browser you must use this method\nvar injector = angular.injector(['ng']);\n\n// provided only as an FYI, the following method WILL NOT WORK outside a web browser\n// this will return the injector singleton for the application in which <element> is defined.\n// for code that runs in a browser you could just use document if ng-app is defined on <html>\n// otherwise you can use any element that is a descendent of the tag your app is defined/bootstrapped on\nvar injector = angular.element(<element>).injector();\n```\n\n### Testing view compilation\n\n```\nvar angular = require('angular'),\n\tinject = angular.injector(['ng']).invoke,\n\tnum;\n\ninject(function ($rootScope, $compile) {\n\tvar el = angular.element('<div>{{ 2 + 2 }}</div>');\n\tel = $compile(el)($rootScope);\n\t$rootScope.$digest();\n\tnum = +el.html();\n});\n\n// num === 4\n```\n\n### Testing event handling\n\n```\nvar angular = require('angular'),\n\tinject = angular.injector(['ng']).invoke,\n\tanswer;\n\ninject(function ($rootScope) {\n\t$rootScope.$on('foo', function (e, val) {\n\t\tanswer = val;\n\t});\n\t$rootScope.$broadcast('foo', 'bar')\n});\n\n// answer === 'bar'\n```\n\n### How to build (reminder for myself)\n\nUpdate `package.json` to the desired version, save but don't commit, then run `node bin/build.js`. Then `git push`\nand `npm publish`.\n",
