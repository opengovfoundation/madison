Madison is a government policy co-creation platform that opens up laws and
legislation previously off-limits to individuals and the Internet community.
Launched to battle the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), it has since been used to
power citizen participation in government policymaking in the United States
Congress. With Madison, you can access the law as it's being written, leave
comments, annotate specific content, and interact with other civic-minded
participants. Madison brings the lawmaking process straight to you, and gives
you a say in your government's decisions.

**How it works:**

1. Sign up and create a username.
1. Verify your email address.
1. Locate a document by browsing through titles, filtering by sponsor, or searching for keywords.
1. Annotate, comment on, and support or oppose the document.
1. Stay connected by signing up for email updates.

When you support or oppose a document, enter a comment, or annotate a specific
section of a work in progress, the document's sponsor receives an electronic
notification. Your interaction with legislation on Madison will provide sponsors
with valuable feedback on how their constituents feel about proposed
legislation, and they may even choose to incorporate suggested edits straight
into their documents.

**What's next?**

Engage with the community. Madison allows you to interact not only with specific
pieces of legislation, but with other civic-minded citizens. See what other
people are saying and share your thoughts. Explore documents from other sponsors
or legislative bodies. And suggest changes or features you'd like to see on
Madison by giving us feedback in the tab at the left-hand side of the page, or
by sending us an email. We'd love to hear from you.
