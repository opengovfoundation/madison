**What is Madison?**

Madison is a free tool that helps elected officials and everyday Americans solve
problems together. Elected officials post drafts of policy documents on the site
so that you can weigh in and stay informed about the issues you care about most.
Madison brings policymaking out into the open, and gives you a voice in your
government and a way to hold it accountable.

**How can I use Madison to be heard on the issues I care about most?**

Government policy covers a huge range of issues that directly impact you, your
family, and your place of work--from where you can park your car, to where your
kids go to school, to how much you pay in taxes. To find a document on a topic you
care about, simply search Madison with keywords, councilmembers' names, or
document status. Then sign up for an account to vote, add general comments, ask
questions, and suggest changes directly to these new laws, rules and
regulations.

**How do I know if my Madison comments and suggestions are read by my local elected officials?**

**What is a verified Madison user and how do I become one?**

A verified user is someone who has proven that they are a real human being, or a
real representative of a real organization. Being a verified user gives your
activity on Madison a little more weight--for example, by showing an elected
official that you're an actual constituent, or by demonstrating that you are an
expert in a pertinent field.

Request verification at the bottom of your profile page.

**Who runs Madison?**

Madison is free, open source software created by The OpenGov Foundation, a
nonpartisan, nonprofit 501(c)3 based in Washington, DC. We build tools to better
connect you with your government officials, help you hold them accountable, and
make sure your government is working for you and your family. We just handle the
technical side of Madison; any policy posted on the site comes directly from
government officials or other users.
