## Madison

Madison is an open-source, collaborative document editing platform.  While Madison can be used to collaborate on many different kinds of documents, the official version is being built with legislative and policy documents in mind.

If you have questions about Madison, please open an issue and we will try to respond as soon as possible.

Check out the [Madison Wiki](https://github.com/opengovfoundation/madison/wiki) or jump right into the [Madison Architecture](https://github.com/opengovfoundation/madison/wiki/madison-architecture/) for more information on the project.

## How to help

Take a look at the [Project Notes](project.md)

* Claim an issue, comment on an issue, or submit a pull request to resolve one
* Document Madison - wiki documentation, installation guide, or docblocks internally
* Clean up existing code - I'm sure we've taken shortcuts or added lazy code somewhere.  Can you find them all?
