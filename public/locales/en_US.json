  "content.faq.body": "<strong>What is Madison?</strong><p>Madison is a free tool that helps elected officials and everyday Americans solve problems together. Elected officials post drafts of policy documents on the site so that you can weigh in and stay informed about the issues you care about most. Madison brings policymaking out into the open, and gives you a voice in your government and a way to hold it accountable.</p>\n<strong>How can I use Madison to be heard on the issues I care about most?</strong>\n<p>Government policy covers a huge range of issues that directly impact you, your family, and your place of work--from where you can park your car, to where your kids go to school, to how much you pay in taxes. To find a bill on a topic you care about, simply search Madison with keywords, councilmembers’ names, or document status. Then sign up for an account to vote, add general comments, ask questions, and suggest changes directly to these new laws, rules and regulations.</p>\n<strong>How do I annotate a document in Madison?</strong>\n<p>Thanks for asking! We’ve made you a helpful gif on the document page showing you how it’s done. (It’s super easy!)</p>\n<strong>How can I get help with a Madison issue or question?</strong>\n<p>To report a technical issue or suggest new Madison features or documents to add, please use the feedback question mark button at the bottom left of every web page.</p>\n<p>To ask questions about Madison or your user account, send us an email at <a href=\"mailto:sayhello@opengovfoundation.org\">sayhello@opengovfoundation.org</a>. We’d love to hear from you!</p>\n<p>To raise a question about a document in Madison, just sign up and add it directly to the document and the discussion.</p>\n<strong>How can I add documents to Madison?</strong>\n<p>Groups and Independent Sponsors have the ability to create documents in Madison.  To create a group go to the Account Dropdown in the upper right ( after logging in ) and go to the Group Management page.  To request Independent Sponsor status, go to the Account Dropdown and your Account Settings page.  Check the box asking to request Independent Sponsor status and submit the form.</p>\n<strong>How do I know if my Madison comments and suggestions are read by my local elected officials?</strong>\n<p>When a document sponsor reads your comment, question or annotation, you will instantly receive both an email notification and a Madison notification.</p>\n<strong>What is a verified Madison user and how do I become one?</strong>\n<p>A verified user is someone who has proven that they are a real human being, or a real representative of a real organization. Being a verified user gives your activity on Madison a little more weight--for example, by showing an elected official that you’re an actual constituent, or by demonstrating that you are an expert in a pertinent field.</p>\n<p>Request verification at the bottom of your profile page.</p>\n<strong>Who runs Madison?</strong>\n<p>Madison is free, open source software created by The OpenGov Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit 501(c)3 based in Washington, DC. We build tools to better connect you with your government officials, help you hold them accountable, and make sure your government is working for you and your family. We just handle the technical side of Madison; any policy posted on the site comes directly from government officials or other users.</p>\n<strong>How can I support the growth and improvement of the Madison community?</strong>\n<p>Join the Madison community! Contribute your suggestions to policy documents, interact with other users, and suggest improvements and changes to the site itself.</p>\n<p>Keep in touch--sign up for news and updates on Madison.</p>\n<p>Contact your elected officials. Madison is built for democracies everywhere, at any level of government. Spread the word!</p>\n<p>If you’re a developer, fork Madison <a href=\"https://github.com/opengovfoundation/madison\" target=\"_blank\">on Github</a>.  Pull requests welcome!</p>\n<strong>How can I bring Madison to my local and state government?</strong>\n<p>Drop us a line at <a href=\"mailto:sayhello@opengovfoundation.org\">sayhello@opengovfoundation.org</a>, and we can help you start a Madison community in your city or state.</p>",

  "content.about.body": "<p>Madison is a government policy co-creation platform that opens up laws and legislation previously off-limits to individuals and the Internet community. Launched to battle the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), it has since been used to power citizen participation in government policymaking in the United States Congress. With Madison, you can access the law as it’s being written, leave comments, annotate specific content, and interact with other civic-minded participants. Madison brings the lawmaking process straight to you, and gives you a say in your government’s decisions.</p>\n  <strong>How it works:</strong>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Sign up and create a username. </li>\n    <li>Verify your email address. </li>\n    <li>Locate a document by browsing through titles, filtering by sponsor, or searching for keywords. </li>\n    <li>Annotate, comment on, and support or oppose the document. </li>\n    <li>Stay connected by signing up for email updates.</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>When you support or oppose a document, enter a comment, or annotate a specific section of a work in progress, the document’s sponsor receives an electronic notification. Your interaction with legislation on Madison will provide sponsors with valuable feedback on how their constituents feel about proposed legislation, and they may even choose to incorporate suggested edits straight into their documents.</p>\n  <strong>What’s next?</strong>\n  <p>Engage with the community. Madison allows you to interact not only with specific pieces of legislation, but with other civic-minded citizens. See what other people are saying and share your thoughts. Explore documents from other sponsors or legislative bodies. And suggest changes or features you’d like to see on Madison by giving us feedback in the tab at the left-hand side of the page, or by sending us an email. We’d love to hear from you.</p>\n  <strong>Coming Soon</strong>\n  <p>Take a look at our <a href=\"https://github.com/opengovfoundation/madison/milestones\">Github Milestones</a> for the most up to date roadmap on Madison.</p>\n  <p>Don't see the improvement you're looking for?

OpenGov has established this Privacy Policy to explain what information we collect through our websites and how it is used.</p>\n<p>In this policy, \"OpenGov\" refers to OpenGov staff, board members, cooperating attorneys, interns, volunteers, and consultants, all of whom are bound by law or contract to keep confidential information they receive as part of their assistance to OpenGov.</p>\n<p>OpenGov does not sell or rent member, donor or website visitor information under any circumstances, and we do not share member, donor or visitor information without prior consent except as compelled by law. (See discussion below.)</p>\n<h2>Information Gathered by OpenGov</h2>\n<p><strong>Logging:</strong> For visitors to our main website (www.OpenGovFoundation.org) and to Madison, we generally log requests.  Circumstances in which OpenGov may need to log and retain technical information for longer than seven days include when we believe it is reasonably necessary for OpenGov’s mission and functionality, including situations such as:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>site testing</li>\n  <li>diagnosis of technical problems</li>\n  <li>defending against attacks to the site</li>\n  <li>handling a spike in traffic or other abnormal, short-term circumstances, or</li>\n  <li>research projects ( in anonymized form ) that serve our overall mission.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In those and similar situations we will delete the information as soon as it is apparent that the information is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was retained. For more information on data logging and techniques OpenGov intends to use to anonymize, obfuscate, aggregate and delete information, see The Electronic Frontier Foundation’s (EFF) <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/wp/osp\" target=\"_blank\">Best Practices for Online Service Providers.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Cookies:</strong> We use persistent ID cookies on this site for account sessions and to ensure that visitors do not receive notifications - such as first-visit sign-up lightboxes - more than intended. We use session cookies on certain portions of the website. Session cookies expire when you close your browser. You can use <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Tor</a> if you wish to keep your connection information anonymous.</p>\n<p><strong>Voluntarily Submitted Information:</strong> In addition, OpenGov collects and retains information you voluntarily submit to us. It is up to you whether to submit information to us, and how much information to provide. If you choose to support OpenGov or otherwise donate to OpenGov, we ask for your name, email address, mailing address and phone number.  For those supporters, we also could ask for your credit card number. We also maintain records of our members' use of Madison or similar websites running the free, open source software Project Madison code and those currently under development.  The project repositories and open source software code are viewable at www.github.com/opengovfoundation).</p>\n<p>We may ask for additional personal information when you provide feedback or comments, or otherwise communicate with us. We are pleased to receive anonymous donations in the mail (P.O. 3672, Washington, DC 20027), but please note that your personal information is required if you choose to donate using an online form.</p>\n<p>From time to time, we may ask for personal information on other portions of the site, such as asking you to sign a petition, participate in a contest, or provide prior art for an open government or software development initiative.</p>\n<p><strong>OpenGov Updates and other Mailing Lists:</strong> If you choose to subscribe to receive Madison or OpenGov updates, or any of our other mailing lists, we collect your name, email address, and, if you choose to provide it, a zip or postal code.</p>\n<p><strong>OpenGov's Use of Information:</strong> In general, OpenGov uses the information provided by you to further its mission, including to protect privacy, to open government at all levels, to defend freedom and innovation, and to protect your rights in the digital world.</p>\n<p><strong>Supporter Information:</strong> We use OpenGov supporter information to process and manage your support or contribution. If you opt in, we will use your email address to send you updates and alerts on protecting your rights in the digital world, so you may contributed your talents and knowledge to a project, take action - such as contacting a friend, your elected representatives or attending an event.</p>\n<p><strong>Invitees to OpenGov:</strong> If you invite another person to support OpenGov or contributed time, knowledge, talent or resources, we will ask for that person's name and online contact information. We use this information to contact and, if necessary, remind that person that he or she has been invited to get involved with OpenGov.</p>\n<p><strong>Publication by OpenGov:</strong> If you provide information for publication we may use your name and contact information you have provided to us to provide you with attribution.</p>\n<p><strong>Other activities:</strong> We may run surveys, contests, or similar activities through this site. Such information will be used for the purposes for which it was collected. We also look at technical information to diagnose problems with or consider improvements to our servers or related technologies and to administer OpenGovFoundation.org and other websites we host or provide.</p>\n<p><strong>Third-Party Service Providers to OpenGov:</strong> Portions of OpenGov sites may be operated by a third-party service provider or providers. These service providers may place session cookies on your computer. OpenGov’s service providers may also log standard technical information, such as the numerical Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site. Our service providers may also store and organize the personal information collected through this site on our behalf.</p>\n<p>OpenGov also may use a third-party credit card processor and hosting providers. For all of OpenGov's service providers, hosting providers and credit card processors and any other providers we may use in the future, the information collected from OpenGov supporters remains under our control, and our agreement with each will require the information to be kept confidential and disclosed only to employees who require such access in the course of their assigned duties. OpenGov also requires all of our third-party service providers to notify OpenGov if they receive legal process seeking information about visitors to OpenGov’s website or users of OpenGov products, software or services. </p>\n<p>OpenGov may change the specific third-party providers from time to time, and will transfer stored information to any new provider subject to similar restrictions and agreements. From time to time, OpenGov may work with third-party consultants or other service providers who may have access to personally identifiable information. In such cases, we will restrict their use of personally identifiable information in accordance with their assigned tasks.</p>\n<p>OpenGov's websites may also provide links to a wide variety of third-party websites, including interactive links to sites like Twitter or mapping services. OpenGov is not responsible for, and does not have any control over, the privacy practices or the content of such third parties. We encourage users to read the privacy policies of any website visited via links from OpenGov’s websites.</p>\n<p>We do occasionally allow our website to interact with other services, like social networking, mapping, and video hosting websites. It is our policy not to include third-party resources when users initially load our web pages, but we may dynamically include them later after giving the user a chance to opt-in. If you believe a third-party resource is automatically loading, please let us know so we can address it.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclosure of Your Information:</strong> While OpenGov endeavors to provide the highest level of protection for your information, we may disclose personally identifiable information about you to third parties in limited circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; or (2) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order.</p>\n<p>If we are required by law to disclose the information that you have submitted, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email, if you have given us an email address, or by postal mail if you have entered a postal address. If you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information. In addition, we will independently object to requests for access to information about users of our site that we believe to be improper.</p>\n<p><strong>Updating or Removing Your Information:</strong> You may choose to correct, update, or delete information you have submitted to us by sending an email requesting changes to sayhello@opengovfoundation.org. Furthermore, if we inadvertently collect more personal information than intended, we endeavor to delete the extraneous information. However, please understand that deleted information may continue to persist on backup media.</p>\n<p><strong>Changes to Our Policies:</strong> OpenGov's Privacy Policy may change from time to time. However, any revised privacy policy will be consistent with OpenGov's mission. If we make any substantive changes to our policies, we will post notice of changes on this page and include them in our subsequent update email to Madison users and other OpenGov updates subscribers.</p>\n<p><strong>Security:</strong> OpenGov employs industry standard security measures to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. </p>\n<p>Although we make good faith efforts to store information collected by OpenGov in a secure operating environment, we cannot guarantee complete security. Information collected by OpenGov will be maintained for a length of time appropriate to our needs. However, we generally do not retain credit card information unless, when the option is available to supporters, you choose to have us make automatic monthly withdrawals from your account for your donation.</p>\n<em>Last Updated: January 22, 2014</em>",
