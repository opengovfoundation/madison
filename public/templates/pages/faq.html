  <strong>What is Madison?</strong>
  <p>Madison is a free tool that helps elected officials and everyday Americans solve problems together. Elected officials post drafts of policy documents on the site so that you can weigh in and stay informed about the issues you care about most. Madison brings policymaking out into the open, and gives you a voice in your government and a way to hold it accountable.</p>
  <strong>How can I use Madison to be heard on the issues I care about most?</strong>
  <p>Government policy covers a huge range of issues that directly impact you, your family, and your place of work--from where you can park your car, to where your kids go to school, to how much you pay in taxes. To find a bill on a topic you care about, simply search Madison with keywords, councilmembers’ names, or document status. Then sign up for an account to vote, add general comments, ask questions, and suggest changes directly to these new laws, rules and regulations.</p>

  <strong>What is a verified Madison user and how do I become one?</strong>

Being a verified user gives your activity on Madison a little more weight--for example, by showing an elected official that you’re an actual constituent, or by demonstrating that you are an expert in a pertinent field.</p>
