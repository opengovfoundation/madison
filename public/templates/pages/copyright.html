  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability for damages.  In addition, “in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the DMCA with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law,” the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright.” Lenz v. Universal, 572 F. Supp. 2d 1150, 1155 (2008)</p>
  <p>The OpenGov Foundation reserves the right to review the allegedly infringing material and independently determine whether it is infringing.</p>

  <p><strong>Counter-Notification: What You Can Do If Your Content Was Removed</strong></p>

    <li>Your full name, address, telephone number, and email address.</li>
    <li>The statement: "I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the district in which my address is located, or if my address is outside of the United States, the judicial district in which OpenGov is located, and will accept service of process from the claimant." OpenGov is located in Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>The statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A scanned physical signature or a valid electronic signature is fine.</p>
  <p>Please send your counter-notice to the OpenGov Foundation, via email (sayhello@OpenGovFoundation.org).</p>
  <p>Please note that under Section 512(f) of the Copyright Act, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.</p>
  <p>After we receive your counter-notification, we will forward it to the party who submitted the original claim of copyright infringement. Please note that when we forward the counter-notification, it includes your personal information. If you are concerned about protecting your anonymity, please consult with an attorney about other options.</p>
  <p>After we send out the counter-notification, the claimant must then notify us within 10 business days that the claimant has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on OpenGov’s site. If we receive such notification we will be unable to restore the material. If we do not receive such notification, generally we will reinstate the material.</p>
  <p>Please also be advised that in appropriate circumstances we terminate repeat infringers.</p>
